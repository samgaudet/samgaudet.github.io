I am always seeking out new things to learn, and new projects to work on.

If you have a project that you think I might be able to help with, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:sgaudet1@babson.edu?[GitHub]%20Lets%20collab!).

I am especially interested in projects helping automate processes for nonprofits, social-minded organizations, or other groups that are working to help others.
